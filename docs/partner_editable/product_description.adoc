Armory is the company driving modern digital transformation with its enterprise version of Spinnaker. Armory's scalable, flexible and secure platform automates software delivery, enabling software teams to ship better software, faster. The core of Armory’s platform is powered by Spinnaker, the continuous delivery platform developed and open-sourced by Netflix and Google to help companies quickly and safely deploy software into multiple clouds. Armory builds on open-source Spinnaker’s foundation, adding proprietary features for bolstered enterprise scale, along with 24x7 enterprise-grade support. Armory’s platform is trusted by dozens of Global 2000 customers in financial services, technology, retail, healthcare and entertainment. Armory is also a proud sponsor of, and contributor to, the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF), the vendor-neutral home of the fastest-growing projects for continuous delivery.

Continuous Delivery is the process of building software that can be put into production on a consistent, understood, and frequent basis. Previously, gluing together scripts to try to deliver software was good enough. Your deployment velocity was very slow and sometimes the whole process would fall over on itself, but it mostly worked most of the time. Armory realizes the vision and promise of continuous delivery by providing a purpose-built tool that allows you to reliably deliver software, to any target, as frequently as you want.

With the Armory Platform's rich ecosystem of integrations, you can automate your code going from commit to production. Once in production, monitor applications. Scale up, scale down, roll back, or roll forward; all these actions can be viewed in Armory and automated.
