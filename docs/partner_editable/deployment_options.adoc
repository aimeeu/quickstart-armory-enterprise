This Quick Start provides one deployment options:

* *Deploy Armory Enterprise into a new VPC (end-to-end deployment)*. This option builds a new AWS environment consisting of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components, and then deploys Armory Enterprise into an Amazon EKS cluster in this new VPC.

The Quick Start provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure CIDR blocks, instance types, and Amazon EKS settings, as discussed later in this guide.
